# Cell.js

*Cell.js* was a framework to simplify web development using *JSON* like structures. 
In the following blog post [https://jasonelle.com/blog/cell-js-is-deprecated/](https://jasonelle.com/blog/cell-js-is-deprecated/), 
*Jasonelle Team* anounced that the *Cell.js* project was now 
deprecated and no longer maintained. 

However, you can access plenty of code examples here 
[https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/celljs](https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/celljs).

*Jasonelle Team* recommends the following frameworks as replacements:

- [https://mithril.js.org/](https://mithril.js.org/)
