# Cell.js

*Cell.js* was a framework to simplify web development using *JSON* like structures. 
As per [this blog post](https://jasonelle.com/blog/cell-js-is-deprecated/), 
the *Cell.js* project is now depreciated and no longer maintained. 

However, you can access plenty of code examples here [https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/celljs](https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/celljs).

*Jasonelle Team* recommends the following frameworks as replacements:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)
