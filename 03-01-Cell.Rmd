# Cell.js

Cell.js was a framework to simplify web development using JSON like structures. As per [this blog post](https://jasonelle.com/blog/cell-js-is-deprecated/), the cell.js project is now depreciated and no longer maintained. However, Jasonette allows for iOS and Android apps to be built in a similar way - using only JSON.
