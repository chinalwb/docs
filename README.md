*Jasonelle* is quite a different way to make an app. Make iOS and Android apps with just a single JSON, loaded over HTTP, local file, or anywhere.

It has never been trivial to have an idea and turn it into an app quickly. Even for genius programmers.

With *Jasonelle* it's easier to make an app. And do it quickly. Using a simple to use declarative JSON based language.

Make an app as fast as it takes to write a blog post.
