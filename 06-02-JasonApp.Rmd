## Jason App 

**{ ·ᴥ·}**

Jason is a single app that lets you summon and bookmark 
multiple Jasonette apps simply by entering the JSON url, 
**without building your own physical app or setting up 
development environment.**

It's good for using as a container for single purpose apps 
or quick disposable apps, prototyping, beta testing, etc.
