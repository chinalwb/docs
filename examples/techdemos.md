## [Web to Native Communication](https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/web-audio-recorder)

This example demostrates how to use native components that could not be accessed normally using the web.

The audio recorder capability is available in the web as getUserMedia.

https://caniuse.com/#search=getUserMedia.

At the time of writing this component is available in Safari iOS. But not when included as an app in home screen (For example using a PWA).

This means that you can not record audio using only HTML and JS inside a website if you want a stand alone app.

Thanks to Jasonette great Web-Native capabilites you can record audio using a native controller.
