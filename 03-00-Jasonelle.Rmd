The following roles can be asignated to one or more people.

| Role | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
|[Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus)| Only can be assigned to `Ethan`. |
|`Fire Keeper` | Part of core team. Main admin. Coordinates All Teams and Jasonelle related tasks. Only can be assigned to one person. |
|`Forgemaster` | Part of core team. Focused mainly in one area. Android, iOS, Docs, Community, etc.
|`Flame` | Sporadical helper. Not part of core team. But can made significant contributions and helping in general. May have to coordinate with a `Forgemaster`.

### Prometheus

This role belongs to `Ethan`. As per wikipedia.

> In Greek mythology, Prometheus (pronounced [promɛːtʰéu̯s], possibly meaning "forethought") 
> is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who is credited 
> with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods by 
> stealing fire and giving it to humanity, an act that enabled progress and civilisation. 
> Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind 
> and also seen as the author of the human arts and sciences generally. 

Same as *Prometheus*, `Ethan` gave us the first fire.

### Fire Keeper

This is a special role. Contains the following responsabilities:

- Pay for the servers and domains and keep them alive.
- Coordinate with `Forgemasters`, `Flames` and community members.
- Define roadmaps and general evolution of the project.
- Desition making.
- Promote Jasonelle.
- Communicate Kindly.

This role is similar to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)
but with the consideration that the `Fire Keeper` could change overtime. 
It's not a "for life" designation or by any means a "dictator". But surely is "benevolent".

Normally is expected that a `Fire Keeper` stays active for at least `2 years`. The `Fire Keeper`
role can only be passed on to a `Forgemaster` if the current `Fire Keeper` decides to move on.

The `Fire Keeper` role can be renewed, revoked or renounced. 

#### Deadman Clause

The `Fire Keeper` must pass the access keys, admin accounts and other related secrets to at least one
trusted `Forgemaster` of its choosing. In case the `Fire Keeper` sundenly dissapears
or is not active in at least *6 months*. 

The chosen `Forgemaster` will be considered the new `Fire Keeper` and have to continue the project
and decide it's future.

This is to mitigate the risk of repeating `Ethan` suddenly dissapearing. 
See [History](https://jasonelle.com/docs/history.html).

### Forgemaster

This role is for people interested in programming, documentation or general support tasks.
Contains the following responsabilities:

- Constantly improve and update code and docs.
- Participate resolving questions in the community.
- Take desitions regarding the area of choice.
- Coordinates with `Fire Keeper` and other members.
- Promote Jasonelle.
- Communicate Kindly.

Only one `Forgemaster` per area can be at the same time. Exceptions could be made
if appropiate.

Normally is expected that a `Forgemaster` stays active for at least `6 months`.

The `Forgemaster` role can be renewed, revoked or renounced.

### Flame

A flame is a trusted member of the community. 
Normally someone who can help the core team in small tasks and sporadically
test code, detect bugs, answer questions or coordinates various tasks with a `Forgemaster`.

A `Flame` is not required to participate actively. But if more than `6 months`
pass without any significant activity. It would be considered `retired`. 
(This status can be changed to `active` if requested later).

The `Flame` role can be renewed, revoked or renounced.

## How to Join?

Being part of the core team of *Jasonelle* requires following some simple rules:

- **Weekly Activity**: At least some weekly activity related to your role is expected. 
It's not required to have 40 hours weeks. 
But at least dedicate a few hours a week to the project in order to have 
meaningful contributions. Find the right balance.

Following the GNU Kind Communication Guidelines. [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html).

- **6 months minimum**: The least amount of time you must invest is 6 months. If you 
want to help but don't want to go full you can be a `Flame` collaborator.

- **Promote Jasonelle**: Friendly talk about *Jasonelle Technology* 
with people that may have interest in making mobile apps. Maybe in meetups
or small talks. Spamming would not be tolerated.

- **Expertise in one or more areas**: iOS, Android, JS, Docs, Etc..

If you think this is something you want to do, please contact the current `Fire Keeper`
with your ideas and why you should be a `Forgemaster` or `Flame`.

The `Fire Keeper` have the rights to fire someone if they:

- Present continuos non kindly behaviour against the project, team or community members.

activities that could affect *Jasonelle* reputation or the community safety.
