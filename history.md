> Ethan:
> I found that it takes too much effort going 
> from having an idea to building an app and having the world use it. 
> I wanted a way to have an idea, turn it into a fully functional native app, 
> and share it with the world, all in the next 10 minutes, almost like writing a blog post.
> That's why I built Jason. Jason is a completely hackable iOS client that does what 
> you tell it to do. You just write a script in JSON and load it from Jason. 
> Jason then interprets it in realtime and turns it into a native app.
