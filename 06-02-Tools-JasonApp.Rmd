## Jason App **{ ·ᴥ·}**

Jason is a single app that lets you summon and bookmark 
multiple Jasonette apps simply by entering the JSON url, 
**without building your own physical app or setting up 
development environment.**

It's good for using as a container for single purpose apps 
or quick disposable apps, prototyping, beta testing, etc.

### How is related to Jasonette?

Maybe it's easier if we put it this way:

*Jason* **{ ·ᴥ·}** is like a Web browser, 
*Jasonette* **{ ˃̵̑ᴥ˂̵̑}** is the Web browser's engine.

### What is it?

**Jason** is an app that lets you bookmark and run multiple
*Jasonette* apps without building your own. 
*Jason* itself is built with *Jasonette*.

**Jasonette** is the open source app framework 
that lets you build your own publishable app.


### When to use?

When you need to...

**Jason**

- Start building without a development environment like *XCode* or *Android Studio*.
- Useful for quick prototyping.
- Beta test your *Jasonette* app with friends before submitting to the app store. Just need to share URL.
- Bookmark and run multiple *Jasonette* apps from a single app.
- Build apps that can't be / don't need to be published to the *App Store*</li>
- Disposable apps, private apps.

**Jasonette**

- When you need to package up an app so you can publish to the **App Store**.

### How to Install

Installing *Jason App* can be achieved by using a pre-build APK 
or a custom made APK.

#### Default Installation (Android Only)

You can download the APK for the default Jasonette components here:
[https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases/download/v1.0/jasonapp.apk](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases/download/v1.0/jasonapp.apk).

An Android Package Kit (APK for short) is the package file 
format used by the Android operating system for 
distribution and installation of mobile apps. 
Just like Windows (PC) systems use an `.exe` 
file for installing software, the APK does the same for Android.

When you download an APK online, 
you're essentially getting an app. 
Most users get apps from the *Google Play Store*, 
without ever seeing the word APK. 
But there are occasions when you would want to do otherwise.

##### How to install an APK from your Android device

You can also install APK files from your browser on your 
Android smartphone or tablet.

- Just open your browser here [https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases/download/v1.0/jasonapp.apk](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases/download/v1.0/jasonapp.apk), 
you should then be able to see it downloading on 
the top bar of your device.

- Once it's downloaded, open Downloads, tap on the APK file, 
and tap `Yes` when prompted.

- The app will begin installing on your device. Simple.

##### Troubleshooting

Before you can install it on your phone you 
will need to make sure that `third-party` apps are allowed on your device.


Go to `Menu > Settings > Security` > and check `Unknown Sources` 
to allow your phone to install apps from sources 
other than the *Google Play Store*.


*Android 8 Oreo and 9 Pie* do things a little differently. 
Rather than check a global setting to allow installation 
from unknown sources, you'll be you'll be prompted to 
allow your browser or file manager to install APKs 
the first time you attempt to do so.

#### Custom Installation (Android/iOS)

This installation is recommended when you want to use the latest code base or simply
apply custom made patches (Example: Additional Components not available in default installation).

Installing *Jason App* is similar to creating a custom *Jasonette App*.
The main difference is that you only made this once and you will be ready
to start testing your JSONs.

- 1. Download *Jasonette* from the releases repository ([https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/releases)).
- 2. Add the Jason url to the project.
- 3. Build it in *XCode* or *Android Studio*.

The url you must use is
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonelle/docs/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app/index.json`

##### Troubleshooting

- On **iOS** if you use this method you have to reinstall the app 
in the next **7 days** or it will stop working. If you want to
use the app longer you have to use [https://developer.apple.com/testflight/](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/), 
but that requires a `$99 USD` per year for an Apple developer account.

### How to Use

Once you installed *Jason* App in your device, start adding
the URLs that contains a valid JSON App. You can use this
by typing the url or scaning a Qr code image.
