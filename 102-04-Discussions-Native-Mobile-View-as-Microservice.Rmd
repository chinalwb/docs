How sandboxed views talk to each other in *Jasonette*.

![](images/discussions/native-mobile-microservice/header.png)


*Jasonette* takes security very seriously. 
The entire architecture was built on a sandbox model that 
took inspiration from web browsers and applied to mobile context.

Each view is completely sandboxed but they can communicate 
with other views through predefined protocols, 
resembling how microservices work ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)).

In this post I will explain:

- How the sandbox model works in *Jasonette*.

- How two views can communicate back and forth using `$href` 
and `$ok` action protocols.

### How Sandbox Model Works in Jasonette

If a language encourages certain design 
patterns that are insecure, regardless of how secure the 
low level architecture is, we should consider the language insecure.


For example, the language could facilitate a way to build an 
entire mobile app as a SINGLE view, based on 
highly inter-wined modules with complex dependency graph. 
This would force anyone who wants to understand and audit the 
code to understand the entire app as a whole. This means fewer 
people will even attempt to do something like this. With fewer 
eyeballs, the application is less secure.


Therefore it is a good idea to break an app out to 
multiple views, each of which performs an atomic 
task, and can communicate with one another in a loosely coupled manner.

To break an app out into multiple units 
*Jasonette* takes the following approach:


- **Sandboxed Containers**: Each View is a sandboxed container. 
One view can’t manipulate another view.
A view can also contain child containers like `agents` and `web` containers, 
which are also sandboxed themselves.

[https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/web/](https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/web/).

[https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/agents/](https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/agents/).


- **Protocol Based Communication between Containers**: All containers 
must communicate with each other through standard protocols 
instead of directly executing actions remotely. 
Otherwise we end up with too tightly coupled dependency, 
which makes the code complex, difficult to reuse unless 
you’re a programmer, and hard to understand.

Let’s look into how the sandbox model works in *Jasonette*.

### Agents and Web Container

In communicating with agents and web containers, 
*Jasonette* puts top priority on security, 
which is why each container and agent is 
completely sandboxed from the outside world, 
and the only way to communicate is through a 
pre-defined JSON-RPC protocol.

### Local Variables

Same goes for communication between views. 
All views are completely sandboxed, you may be able to transition 
from one view to another, and you may be able to pass messages, 
but one view cannot directly execute actions in another view.

Also, all local variables are 
sandboxed per view. There are two types of read/write 
local variables, “local” meaning they are 
sandboxed to the parent view.

- **Ephemeral Local Variable**: Tied to a view through URL, 
only on memory, so it goes away when the user navigates away. 
You can write through `$set` action and read through `$get`

- **Cache Local Variable**: Similar to ephemeral local variable, 
but stays persisted instead of going away after the user 
navigates away. You can write through `$cache.set` and read 
through `$cache.[variable name]`.


**This means View A can’t access anything that 
belongs to View B and vice versa**. 
This is the security model web browsers use, 
and is critical to building secure apps with loosely coupled views.


Just to be clear, 
there *does* exist a way to implement a shared 
data layer using `$global` but that’s out of scope 
for this article. The point is, 
when you define a local variable from a view, 
there is no way other views can access them.


OK it’s great to know it’s secure, but a question arises:

> “What if I want View A and View B to communicate?”.

### Cross-View Communication Protocol

We have a new addition to *Jasonette*
that makes this possible while securing 
the sandboxed nature of views. Here’s a typical sequence of events:

- View A sends data to View B.
- View B uses the data to carry out tasks and return a response back to View A.
- View A can continue on with the return value it received from View B.


Does this sound familiar? It’s like a *function* call!.
Also, it is a similar security model to the 
request-and-response model employed by agents and web container.


Below I’ll explain each step of the communication process.


#### Step 1. Calling a View with Parameters

First we pass some parameters to the next view through `$href` action. 
You define parameters under the `options` attribute.

Here we pass two parameters `firstName` and `lastName`:

```json
{
  "type": "$href",
  "options": {
    "url": "https://jasonbase.com/things/3fj.json",
    "options": {
      "firstName": "Bart",
      "lastName": "Simpson"
    }
  }
}
```

The attributes will be accessible as `$params.firstName`
and `$params.lastName` from the next view. 
This feature has been available from the beginning, 
so you may already know this.


#### Step 2. Go Back to Previous View with Return Values

**This feature is new**. 
To return values back to the caller view, 
we use an action called `$ok`. Previously the only 
option we had of going back to the previous view was `$back`, 
which simply went back a level but didn’t have ability to 
pass a return value back.


We can trigger `$ok` at any point in the view lifecycle. 
For example, we can immediately trigger it on `$load` to make it
return immediately, like this:

```json 
{
  "$jason": {
    "head": {
      "title": "Return Immediately!",
      "actions": {
        "$load": {
          "type": "$ok",
          "options": {
            "fullName": "{{$params.firstName}} {{$params.lastName}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or we could let the user manually trigger `$ok` . 
This can be useful for accepting user input and 
returning the value to the previous view. For example:

```json

{
  "$jason": {
    "head": {
      "title": "Form"
    },
    "body": {
      "sections": [{
        "items": [{
          "type": "textfield",
          "name": "username"
        }, {
          "type": "textfield",
          "name": "password",
        }, {
          "type": "button",
          "text": "Login",
          "action": {
            "type": "$ok",
            "options": {
              "username": "{{$get.username}}",
              "password": "{{$get.password}}"
            }
          }
        }]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

You can basically implement the `$ok` action anywhere 
to return to the previous view with return values. 
Here’s an example where a QR code scanner returns 
the scanned value back to the previous view:

```
{
  "$jason": {
    "head": {
      "title": "QR Scanner",
      "actions": {
        "$vision.ready": {
          "type": "$vision.scan"
        },
        "$vision.onscan": {
          "type": "$ok",
          "options": {
            "response": "{{$jason.content}}"
          }
        },
        // ...
```

#### Step 3. Process the Return Value with “success” callback

In step 1 I only discussed a simple `$href` case where 
all it does is send some parameters to the next view. 
The `$href` action didn’t have a way to handle its return value.


So even if we did everything 
correctly from the next view and 
returned via `$ok` action, there would not be a way to deal with them.


Let’s make a small tweak to the 
JSON markup and add a success callback to handle the return value:

```json
{
  "type": "$href",
  "options": {
    "url": "https://jasonbase.com/things/3fj.json",
    "options": {
      "firstName": "Bart",
      "lastName": "Simpson"
    }
  },
  "success": {
    "type": "$util.alert",
    "options": {
      "title": "Full Name",
      "description": "Full Name is: {{$jason.fullName}}"
    }
  }
}
```


When you come back from the other 
view through the `$ok` action, its options 
object is returned as `$jason`, and you can 
continue on with the rest of the action call chain.


So what actually happens when *Jasonette* runs the above `$href` markup is:

- It transitions to the next view with `Bart` and `Simpson` as parameters.

- Meanwhile, the caller view is waiting for the 
callee view to return with `$ok`. Rest of the action call chain is paused.

- The next view immediately comes back to the 
caller view and returns `"Bart Simpson"` 
stored under `fullName` attribute.

- Now that the caller view has access to 
the `fullName` attribute through `$jason` variable, 
it can continue on with rest of the action call chain.


### Conclusion

Building apps in a tightly 
coupled manner results in **less transparency and consequently less security**.


This is why breaking an app down to 
multiple functional sandboxed views is a 
good idea and why that forms the basis of 
*Jasonette*’s core architecture. 
The two way communication protocol between 
*Jasonette* views ensure that views are loosely coupled.


This architecture is similar to the 
secure sandbox model of web browsers, 
but it also adds one additional ability 
that web browsers don’t support. It lets views 
communicate with each other through the `$href` and `$ok` protocols, 
resembling a microservice architecture but implemented on 
the mobile frontend.
