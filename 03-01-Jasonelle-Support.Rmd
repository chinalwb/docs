> I have a concrete background and foundation in the creative industry, 
> not only as a designer, but also as a programmer. 
> I am happiest (and most productive) spending time in my own matrix: 
> troubleshooting, coding, writing automation scripts and 
> I have done so on servers all over the globe.

> I am currently the head of Ventum SA and believe, if I can’t find 
> the right software solutions for you, we will write it.

> My journey with Jasonelle started in 2018 stemming from a 
> client brief requiring an in-house corporate application, 
> providing information to their distributed sales team of over 200. 
> As a result, I couldn't be happier to have them on Jasonelle, 
> now with an app in both the Android and iOS App stores.
> As a backend developer, Jasonelle ticked all the boxes, 
> allowing me to continue to develop rad tech, knowing that 
> Jasonelle's architecture and close-knit community spirit will make 
> lightweight of any UX requirement.
