# Jasonette

Quite a different way to make an app. Make iOS and Android apps 
with just a single JSON, loaded over HTTP, local file, or anywhere.

It has never been trivial to have an idea and turn it into an app quickly. 
Even for genius programmers.

With *Jasonette*, you don't even have to be a programmer. 
Anyone can make an app. And do it in minutes, not days or weeks.

Make an app as fast as it takes to write a blog post.
