# Welcome

*Jasonelle* Family is made of several components that share *JSON* as the main language.

## Cool things about Jasonelle

- **100% NATIVE**: Jasonelle maps *JSON* into native components and native function calls. There is no gimmick. There is no magic.
- **App loads over HTTP (or local file)**: Your app exists 100% as JSON, and loads from the cloud or local. No more hard-coding.
- **An app in 30 minutes**: No kidding, build an app in 30 minutes.
- **Lowest possible learning curve**: No programming experience required. There's a small amount of things you need to know: JSON (And maybe a little JavaScript). Which means you can build an app without "becoming a programmer".

## Old Docs

The vast mayority of the old docs are still valid and useful.

## Examples
